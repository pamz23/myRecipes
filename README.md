## Target Audience
Our target audience can be described as an individual ranging from 20-35 who loves to cook! 
Whether its regular meal prep to hit your fitness goals or the go-to weekly meals for the family, My Recipe is perfect for inspiration and convenience.

## The problem
Managing weekly meal planning and cooking can be challenging. Especially when you find yourself juggling multiple apps to organise your recipes and create shopping lists. </br>

## Our solution
Our solution aims to solve the fragmentation of finding, saving recipes and determining what ingredients to buy. It offers integration of these features into a single platform, eliminating the need to juggle multiple applications. Users can view recipes in the app, bookmark them for later reference, and effortlessly generate grocery lists in real-time with specific quantities based on their chosen recipe.
